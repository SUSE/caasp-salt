# The current registration procedure for a new member is through a token.
# Removing the member directory on each app restart causes the instance to
# fail because it expects the registered token and the instance provides a new
# one.

# The line below makes sure that if the proxy and member dirs exist
# simultaneously, the member dir is removed so the instance can start. The 
# default behavior is to fail if both dirs exist.
# If the etcd member is broken this should be fixed manually by removing both
# directories and restarting the application.
