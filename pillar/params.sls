# etcd details
# notes:
# - the token must be shared between all the machines in the cluster
# - the discovery id is also unique for all the machines in the
#   cluster (in fact, it can be the same as the token)
# - if masters is null, we will determine the number of etcd members
#   based on the recommended member count (currently, 3)
# - For an etcd cluster to be effective, the number of cluster members
#   must be both odd and reasonably small, for example - 1,3,5 are
#   valid while 2,4,6 are not. In addition, clusters larger than 5 are
#   likely spending more time coordinating amongst themselves than they
#   are serving clients. As such, it's not recommended to use a cluster
#   of 7+ nodes.
