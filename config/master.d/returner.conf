  # salt does not support specifying the UNIX socket location here - as a workaround,

    # This queries allows us to override our pillar values up to a depth of 3.
    #
    # Considering we have on our static pillar:
    #
    #   certificate_information:
    #     subject_properties:
    #       C: DE
    #       O: SUSE
    #       ...
    #
    # We are able to prioritize pillar information overriding the default values.
    #
    # In this example, if we had a mysql row:
    #   INSERT INTO pillars(pillar, value) VALUES ("certificate_information:subject_properties:O",
    #                                              "My Company");
    #
    # We would see on the pillar:
    #
    #   certificate_information:
    #     subject_properties:
    #       C: DE
    #       O: My Company
    #       ...
    #
    # Please, note that this will only work until a depth of 3 properties. If we want to provide
    # more depth, we would need to add more columns, as salt treats each column as a nested property
    # inside the previous one. For further information, please visit:
